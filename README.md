# Covicure ü©∫üíä

Covicure is a full-stack healthcare web application that combines real-time COVID-19 updates, an e-commerce platform for medicines and lab tests, and a blood donor management system. This application is designed to simplify access to healthcare while providing secure and seamless functionalities to its users.

## Features üöÄ
### ü¶† Real-Time COVID-19 Stats
- Displays live COVID-19 data, including confirmed cases, recoveries, and deaths.
- Data fetched from a public **COVID-19 API** for global updates.
### üõçÔ∏è E-Commerce for Healthcare
- Users can browse a **catalog of medicines** and **pathological lab tests**.
- Add products to a **shopping cart** and **place orders**.
### ü©∏ Blood Donor Management
- **Find local blood donors** using a local API.
- **Join as a blood donor**, with data securely stored in a **MongoDB cluster** for public access after verification.
### üîê Secure User Authentication
- **JWT authentication** for login and signup.
- **Bcrypt** for password encryption.
### üìã Cart Functionality
- Add lab tests and medicines to the cart.
- Complete the checkout process to place orders.

## Technical Summary
### 1. Frontend 
The frontend is built using **React.js** and features a responsive and interactive user interface. 

#### Key Highlights:
- **React Router**: Used for navigation between pages.
- **State Management**: Utilizes `useState`, `useReducer`, and the Context API for managing user authentication and cart state.
- **Styling**: Designed with Bootstrap and custom CSS for a clean and responsive UI.

#### Key Pages:
- **Home**: Displays COVID-19 awareness content.
- **Buy Page**: Lists products available for purchase.
- **Book Test**: Allows users to book lab tests.
- **Find Donor**: Helps users locate plasma or blood donors.
- **Cart**: Manages products added to the cart.
- **Signup/Login**: Facilitates user registration and authentication.

### 2. Backend
The backend is built using **Node.js** with **Express.js** to create a RESTful API for business logic and data handling.

#### Key Features:
- **API Endpoints**:
  - `/auth`: Handles user authentication (signup, login, logout).
  - `/products`: Fetches product listings and manages cart operations.
  - `/tests`: Handles lab test bookings.
  - `/donors`: Retrieves donor data based on user queries.
  - `/cart`: Manages user shopping cart.
- **Middleware**:
  - Body parsing for request data.
  - JWT for secure authentication.
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive handling for unexpected errors.

## High-Level Design (HLD) üèóÔ∏è

### Architecture
Frontend (React.js)
        |
        |-----> React Router for navigation
        |
Backend (Node.js + Express.js)
        |
        |-----> API Endpoints
        |
Database (MongoDB)


### Data Flow
1. **Frontend Interaction**: Users interact with the React-based frontend through various UI components.
   - For example, clicking on "Find Donor" sends a request to fetch donor information.
2. **API Processing**: 
   - The request is routed to the backend (Node.js + Express.js) via API endpoints.
   - Middleware handles authentication (if required) and processes the request.
3. **Database Operations**:
   - The backend interacts with MongoDB via Mongoose to fetch or update data.
   - Example: Fetching a list of available donors from the `Donors` collection.
4. **Response Rendering**: The backend sends the processed response to the frontend, which dynamically updates the UI.

### Key Components and Responsibilities
1. **Frontend (React.js)**:
   - React Router is used for navigation.
   - Context API and `useReducer` manage global states such as authentication and cart management.
   - Axios is used to make API requests.

2. **Backend (Node.js + Express.js)**:
   - Handles business logic and serves RESTful API endpoints.
   - Middleware is implemented for request validation, authentication, and error handling.
   - Secure user authentication with JSON Web Tokens (JWT).

3. **Database (MongoDB)**:
   - NoSQL database for storing structured data.
   - Collections include:
     - `Users`: Stores user credentials and session data.
     - `Products`: Details of items available for purchase.
     - `Donors`: Information about registered plasma or blood donors.
     - `LabTests`: Records of booked lab tests.
     - `Orders`: User order history.
